      <p className="mb-6">Legal Representation for AAT Reviews, Refusals & Cancellations</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        A visa refusal or cancellation does not always mean the end of your Australian migration journey. In many cases, you have the right to appeal the decision through legal channels.
        The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) offers a way to review decisions made by the Department of Home Affairs independently. With experienced legal support, your chances of success can be significantly improved.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        At Carmine Mercorella Legal, we guide individuals and families through the complex appeals process. From urgent lodgement of applications to professional representation at hearings,
        we ensure your rights are protected and your case is thoroughly presented.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What Is a Visa Appeal?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A visa appeal is a formal review of a decision made by the Department of Home Affairs. This usually involves a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT),
        which considers new evidence and arguments. You can appeal most onshore refusals and cancellations, and your appeal must be lodged within a strict timeframe.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Who Handles Visa Appeals?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The AAT Migration and Refugee Division is responsible for reviewing visa refusals and cancellations. The Tribunal operates independently of the Department of Home Affairs
        and is required to provide a fair and just process. In rare cases, Ministerial Intervention may be available after an unsuccessful appeal.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Visa Types You Can Appeal</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Missing these deadlines means you may lose the right to appeal. It is critical to get legal advice immediately after receiving your decision letter.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What Happens During a Visa Appeal?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        After lodging your appeal, the AAT will notify you of the next steps. This may include submitting additional evidence, providing written submissions,
        or attending a hearing. The Tribunal will make a decision to affirm, set aside, or remit the matter for reconsideration.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Ministerial Intervention</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your appeal is unsuccessful at the AAT, you may request Ministerial Intervention. This is a discretionary power and is only granted in exceptional cases
        where it is in the public interest. Legal support is essential in preparing a compelling request.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Can I Stay in Australia During My Appeal?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In most cases, a Bridging Visa will allow you to remain lawfully in Australia while your appeal is being processed. However, the conditions of this visa can vary
        and may include work or travel restrictions. We assist with managing bridging visa conditions and extensions.
