      <p className="mb-6">Employer & State-Sponsored Migration Support from Carmine Mercorella Legal</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Sponsored visas allow skilled workers to live and work in Australia by receiving formal sponsorship from an employer or a state/territory government.
        These pathways are crucial for addressing labour shortages in key industries across Australia. At Carmine Mercorella Legal, we assist both individuals and businesses
        with the legal and procedural requirements of sponsored migration.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Whether you are applying for a temporary work visa, a regional provisional visa, or a permanent employer-nominated visa, our legal team provides strategic advice
        to optimise your success. We also assist employers in meeting sponsorship obligations, ensuring compliance with immigration law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Types of Sponsored Visas</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Subclass 482 – Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS):</strong> Short and Medium-term streams, requiring employer sponsorship.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclass 186 – Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS):</strong> Permanent visa through direct entry or transition from a 482.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclass 494 – Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional:</strong> Provisional 5-year visa for regional areas with a pathway to PR.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclass 491 – Skilled Work Regional (State Nominated):</strong> Points-tested, temporary visa requiring state or family nomination.</li>
        <li><strong>Subclass 190 – Skilled Nominated Visa:</strong> Permanent points-tested visa sponsored by an Australian state or territory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Employer-Sponsored Visas</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Employer-sponsored visas require a business to nominate a skilled position and sponsor a worker who meets the criteria.
        The sponsoring employer must be an approved sponsor and demonstrate a genuine need for the role. In most cases, Labour Market Testing (LMT)
        is required to prove that no qualified Australians are available to fill the role.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The most common pathway is the Temporary Skill Shortage visa (Subclass 482), which allows skilled workers to stay in Australia for up to 4 years.
        Some occupations on the short-term list do not lead to permanent residency, while medium-term roles may offer a path to the Subclass 186.
        The Subclass 186 visa provides permanent residence through either the Temporary Residence Transition (TRT) stream or the Direct Entry stream.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Regional Sponsored Visas</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Subclass 494 visa targets skilled workers nominated by regional employers. It is valid for five years and allows you to live, work and study
        in designated regional areas. After three years, you may be eligible to transition to the permanent Subclass 191 visa.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The 494 visa requires skills assessment, competent English, and at least three years of skilled work experience. Employers must be based in
        a regional postcode and obtain a regional certifying body (RCB) assessment as part of the nomination process.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">State and Territory Sponsorship</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        State-nominated skilled visas are part of Australia’s General Skilled Migration (GSM) program. These include the Subclass 190 (permanent) and Subclass 491 (provisional).
        Applicants must lodge an Expression of Interest (EOI) through SkillSelect and meet the nomination requirements of their chosen state or territory.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Each state publishes its own occupation list and criteria, including residency, English ability, and work experience.
        Once nominated, the applicant receives an invitation to apply for the visa. The Subclass 491 offers a pathway to permanent residency via the Subclass 191 visa after 3 years.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Documents & Eligibility</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Costs and Processing Times</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

        <li>Subclass 186: from $4,640 (main applicant)</li>

      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Processing times vary depending on stream and completeness of the application. TSS visas can be processed in 2–5 months, while 186 and 494 may take 6–12 months.
        State-nominated visas depend on the issuing state and SkillSelect invitation rounds.
